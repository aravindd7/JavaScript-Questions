###### 1. Explain the lifecycle methods of components?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

- **getInitialState()**: This is executed before the creation of the component.
- **componentDidMount()**: Is executed when the component gets rendered and placed on the DOM.
- **shouldComponentUpdate()**: Is invoked when a component determines changes to the DOM and returns a “true” or “false” value based on certain conditions.
- **componentDidUpdate()**: Is invoked immediately after rendering takes place.
- **componentWillUnmount()**: Is invoked immediately before a component is destroyed and unmounted permanently.
